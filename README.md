Project Description

This project aims to analyze customer data and perform customer segmentation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering. The dataset contains information about customers, including their education, marital status, income, purchase history, and response to marketing campaigns.

Installation

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies by running the following commands:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt

Data

The dataset is provided in CSV format and contains the following columns:

    ID: Customer ID
    Year_Birth: Year of Birth of the customer
    Education: Education level of the customer (e.g., Graduation, PhD, Master)
    Marital_Status: Marital status of the customer (e.g., Married, Single, Divorced)
    Income: Income of the customer
    Kidhome: Number of children in the household
    Teenhome: Number of teenagers in the household

    MntWines: Amount spent on wines in the last 2 years
    NumWebVisitsMonth: Number of visits to the website in the last month
    AcceptedCmp3: 1 if the customer accepted the marketing campaign 3, 0 otherwise
    AcceptedCmp4: 1 if the customer accepted the marketing campaign 4, 0 otherwise
    AcceptedCmp5: 1 if the customer accepted the marketing campaign 5, 0 otherwise
    AcceptedCmp1: 1 if the customer accepted the marketing campaign 1, 0 otherwise
    AcceptedCmp2: 1 if the customer accepted the marketing campaign 2, 0 otherwise
    Complain: 1 if the customer filed a complaint, 0 otherwise
    Z_CostContact: Cost of the campaign

    Response: 1 if the customer accepted the last campaign, 0 otherwise

Usage

    First, ensure you have installed all the required dependencies as mentioned in the "Installation" section.

    Open the Jupyter Notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb to run the analysis.

    The notebook contains detailed explanations and code cells. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform PCA, visualize data, and apply K-Means Clustering.

    The customer segmentation results will be displayed in visualizations and clusters in the notebook.
